# Don't create bazel-* symlinks in the WORKSPACE directory, except `bazel-out`,
# which is mandatory.
# These require .gitignore and may scare users.
# Also, it's a workaround for https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_typescript/issues/12
# which affects the common case of having `tsconfig.json` in the WORKSPACE directory.
#
# Instead, the output will appear in `dist/bin`. You'll need to ignore the
# `bazel-out` directory that is created in the workspace root.
